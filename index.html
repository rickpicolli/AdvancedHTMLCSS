                    <p>My name is Ricardo Picolli and I hold a bachelor's degree in Psychology. </p>
                    <p>I was always passionate about helping people and in order to achieve this goal in my life I became a psychologist.  Besides that, I really enjoyed studying the human nature.</p>
                    <p>However, by the time I started working as a psychologist, treating people in a clinic or working with human resources, I realized that this wasnâ€™t something that makes me happy in my daily life. Therefore when I moved to San Francisco I started thinking about changing my career and what could make me happy. After a lot of reflection and studying, I discovered that coding could be what I was looking for.</p>
                    <p>I really like the idea of creating something from scratch and with the potential to help people or make a difference in their lives and this is the reason I became passionate about coding and want to become a Web Developer in the future.</p>
                    <p>As for hobbies, I really like watching Movies and Tv shows, play board games and videogames and hiking.</p>
                    <p>A quote that I would like to share is: "Even if things don't unfold the way you expected, don't be disheartened or give up. One who continues to advance will win in the end." - Daisaku Ikeda</p>
